## Key Steering Information from Manual

### 1. **Steering Cylinder Control**

**Location**: Control Panel - Steering Cylinder Control Area (Section V-15)

**Control Elements**:
- **Extending the steering cylinders**: Press and hold button (lamp ON = active)
- **Retracting the steering cylinders**: Press and hold button (lamp ON = active)

**Key Points**:
- Steering cylinders are retracted/extended individually via pushbuttons in control cabin
- Visualization shows extended stroke of individual steering cylinders in mm
- All steering cylinders have the same stroke

### 2. **Steering System Configuration**

#### **3-Cylinder System** (Section 4.5.1)
- Cylindric machine body consists of two parts interconnected by three hydraulic cylinders
- Front part: **Steering head**
- Rear part: **Machine pipe**
- Cylinders arranged: I (top), II (120°), III (240°)

#### **4-Cylinder System** (Section 4.5.2)
- Four hydraulic cylinders
- Cylinders arranged: I, II, III, IV

### 3. **Prerequisites for Steering**

**Critical Requirements**:
- ✅ Steering movements are **only allowed when advance operation is in progress**
- ✅ **Cutterhead tool must be rotating**
- ⚠️ **Strong and rough steering movements must be avoided**

---

### 4. **Steering Movements - Normal Position**

**Normal Position**:
- All steering cylinders at **mid-stroke**
- This is the ideal starting position for all steering movements

### **3-Cylinder System Steering Procedures**:

#### **Straight Movement**:
- Must be performed **without steering movement**
- Strokes of all steering cylinders must be **identical**

#### **Steering Upward**:
1. Retract cylinder I by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinders II and III by same steering stroke

#### **Steering Downward**:
1. Retract cylinders II and III by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinder I by same steering stroke

#### **Steering Right**:
1. Retract cylinder II by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinders I and III by same steering stroke

#### **Steering Left**:
1. Retract cylinder III by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinders I and II by same steering stroke

### **4-Cylinder System Steering Procedures**:

#### **Steering Upward**:
1. Retract cylinders I and IV by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinders II and III by same steering stroke

#### **Steering Downward**:
1. Retract cylinders II and III by preselected steering stroke
2. Extend cylinders I and IV by same steering stroke

### 5. **Steering Guidelines (Critical Information)**

**From Section V-70: Additional Information About Steering**

#### **Important Guidelines**:
1. **Larger course deviations** must be returned to nominal axis over a **longer distance**
2. **Move in slight curves** - never steer sharp bends
3. **Sharp bends can cause advance pipes to break**
4. **Never move in a curve** when traversing a concrete-covered intermediate shaft
5. **First steering movement** may only be initiated after machine has left the shaft by an **entire advance pipe length**

#### **Comments**:
- There is a **fixed connection** between the mensuration unit and the machine pipe
- Each steering movement moves the machine pipe with the aiming device
- This means the aiming device moves with each steering correction

### 6. **Steering in Different Ground Conditions**

#### **Normal Soil**:
- All steering movements can best be initiated from normal position
- Normal position = all cylinders at mid-stroke

#### **Very Hard Soils**:
- Special procedures apply (see Section V-69 for 3-cylinder, V-73 for 4-cylinder)
- Requires different approach than normal soil

### 7. **Steering Stroke Information**

**Key Points**:
- All steering cylinders have the **same stroke**
- Experience shows that **extreme steering movement with maximum stroke difference is hardly ever needed**
- Visualization shows extended stroke of individual steering cylinders in **mm**

---

### 8. **Safety Considerations**

**Danger Areas** (Section III-51):
- The area of the **steering cylinders** is considered a **particularly dangerous area** during any work in the tunnel boring machine
- Exercise extreme caution when working near steering cylinders

---

### 9. **Emergency Procedures**

**Releasing Blocked Cutting Tool** (Section V-62):
If cutting tool is blocked:
1. Set all cutting-tool-relevant potentiometers to 0
2. Relieve the thrust cylinders
3. When installed, relieve the jacking and telescopic stations
4. **Fully retract the steering cylinders**
5. Change sense of rotation of cutting tool

## Comparison with Our Steering Calculator

### **Matches with Our System**:
✅ 3-cylinder and 4-cylinder systems supported  
✅ Cylinder positions shown in mm  
✅ Mid-stroke (25mm for 50mm stroke) as normal position  
✅ Steering movements affect machine alignment  
✅ Progressive corrections recommended (matches "slight curves" guidance)

### **Additional Insights from Manual**:
- Steering only allowed during advance operation
- Cutterhead must be rotating
- Avoid strong/rough movements
- Sharp bends can break pipes
- Fixed connection between mensuration unit and machine pipe

### **Recommendations for Our Calculator**:
1. Add warning: "Steering only allowed during advance operation"
2. Add warning: "Avoid sharp bends - use gradual corrections"
3. Consider adding "emergency retract all cylinders" function
4. Document that normal position = mid-stroke = 25mm (for 50mm stroke)
