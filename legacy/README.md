# Legacy MTBM Projects

This folder contains earlier work and prototypes for MTBM analysis, preserved for reference and historical context.

## Contents

### AVN1200-ML
Early steering accuracy machine learning prototype for AVN 1200 series equipment.

### AVN800-Drive-Protocol
Initial drive protocol optimization and real-time performance monitoring system.

### Analysis Scripts
- `cutter_wear_prediction_ml.py` - Cutter wear prediction models
- `deviation_visualization.py` - Tunnel deviation analysis and visualization
- `feature_engineering_demo.py` - Feature engineering examples and demonstrations
- `steering_formulas_explanation.py` - Mathematical formulas for steering calculations

### Data Files
- `cutter_wear_analysis.csv` - Cutter wear historical data
- `deviation_analysis.csv` - Deviation measurement data

## Evolution

These projects represent the foundational work that evolved into the comprehensive **Tunneling Performance Analytics** framework (main repository content). They demonstrate the iterative development process and progressive refinement of analytical approaches.

## Current Project

For the latest, production-ready analytics framework, see the main repository files:
- Comprehensive ML pipeline with 4 algorithms
- Professional Power BI dashboard specifications
- 50+ SQL queries for operational analytics
- Complete documentation and portfolio presentation materials
