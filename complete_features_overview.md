# Complete MTBM Feature Engineering Overview

## Core Steering & Alignment Features âœ…

### 1. Total Deviation Calculation
```python
total_deviation = sqrt(horizontalÂ² + verticalÂ²)
```
- **Implementation**: `df['total_deviation_machine'] = np.sqrt(df['hor_dev_machine']**2 + df['vert_dev_machine']**2)`
- **Purpose**: Combines 2D deviation into single magnitude
- **ML Value**: Reduces 2 features to 1 meaningful metric

### 2. Deviation Difference  
```python
deviation_difference = drill_head_deviation - machine_deviation
```
- **Implementation**: `df['deviation_difference'] = df['total_deviation_drill_head'] - df['total_deviation_machine']`
- **Purpose**: Shows alignment between cutting head and machine body
- **Interpretation**: Positive = drill head worse, Negative = machine worse

### 3. Alignment Quality Score
```python
alignment_quality = 1 / (1 + total_deviation)
```
- **Implementation**: `df['alignment_quality'] = 1 / (1 + df['total_deviation_machine'])`
- **Purpose**: Normalized 0-1 quality score (higher = better)
- **Thresholds**: >0.8 Excellent, 0.5-0.8 Good, 0.3-0.5 Acceptable, <0.3 Poor

## Additional Feature Categories

### 4. Steering System Features
```python
# Steering effort and patterns
steering_cylinder_range = max(cylinders) - min(cylinders)  # Steering effort
avg_cylinder_stroke = mean(all_cylinders)                  # Average position  
cylinder_variance = var(all_cylinders)                     # Consistency
steering_asymmetry = abs(mean_cylinder_stroke)             # Bias detection
```

**Engineering Insights**:
- Large range = aggressive steering corrections
- High variance = inconsistent steering
- Asymmetry indicates systematic bias

### 5. Excavation Efficiency Features
```python
# Performance and energy metrics
specific_energy = total_force / advance_speed              # Energy per unit advance
cutting_efficiency = advance_speed / revolution_rpm        # Speed per RPM
pressure_efficiency = advance_speed / working_pressure     # Speed per pressure
power_utilization = (total_force * advance_speed) / 1000   # Power estimate (kW)
```

**Engineering Insights**:
- Lower specific energy = more efficient operation
- Higher cutting efficiency = better RPM utilization
- Power utilization helps optimize energy consumption

### 6. Ground Condition Indicators
```python
# Soil resistance and penetration characteristics
ground_resistance = earth_pressure / advance_speed         # Soil resistance
penetration_rate = advance_speed / total_force            # Force efficiency
pressure_ratio = earth_pressure / working_pressure        # Pressure relationship
excavation_difficulty = total_force / revolution_rpm      # Force per RPM
```

**Engineering Insights**:
- High ground resistance = hard soil conditions
- Low penetration rate = difficult excavation
- Pressure ratio >1.0 = challenging ground conditions

### 7. Machine Performance Features
```python
# Overall system performance
operational_efficiency = advance_speed / specific_energy   # Overall efficiency
system_stability = 1 / (1 + cylinder_variance)           # Steering stability
drive_consistency = advance_speed.rolling(5).std()       # Speed consistency
force_consistency = total_force.rolling(5).std()         # Force consistency
```

### 8. Temporal & Trend Features
```python
# Time-based patterns and trends
window = 5
deviation_trend = polyfit_slope(total_deviation, window)   # Deviation trend
efficiency_trend = polyfit_slope(cutting_efficiency, window) # Efficiency trend
pressure_trend = polyfit_slope(earth_pressure, window)    # Pressure trend

# Moving averages for stability
advance_speed_ma3 = advance_speed.rolling(3).mean()       # 3-point average
total_force_ma5 = total_force.rolling(5).mean()          # 5-point average
```

**Engineering Insights**:
- Positive deviation trend = getting worse
- Negative deviation trend = improving
- Moving averages smooth out sensor noise

### 9. Time-Based Features
```python
# Operational timing patterns
time_diff = datetime.diff().dt.total_seconds() / 3600     # Hours between readings
progress_rate = tunnel_length.diff() / time_diff          # m/hour progress
hour_of_day = datetime.dt.hour                           # Time of day (0-23)
day_of_week = datetime.dt.dayofweek                      # Day of week
shift = 'night' if hour < 6 or hour > 18 else 'day'     # Shift classification
```

### 10. Lag Features (Previous Actions)
```python
# Historical context features
for col in ['advance_speed', 'total_force', 'earth_pressure'] + cylinder_cols:
    df[f'{col}_prev'] = df[col].shift(1)                 # Previous value
    df[f'{col}_change'] = df[col] - df[f'{col}_prev']    # Change from previous
    df[f'{col}_change_rate'] = change / time_diff        # Rate of change
```

**Engineering Insights**:
- Previous values provide context for current conditions
- Change features capture dynamic behavior
- Rate features normalize for different time intervals

### 11. Risk Indicators
```python
# Risk assessment features
deviation_risk = (total_deviation > quantile_80).astype(int)    # High deviation risk
efficiency_risk = (cutting_efficiency < quantile_20).astype(int) # Low efficiency risk  
pressure_risk = (earth_pressure > quantile_90).astype(int)     # High pressure risk
combined_risk_score = deviation_risk + efficiency_risk + pressure_risk
```

```python
# Calculate key metrics for display
total_dev = sqrt(h_devÂ² + v_devÂ²)
quality_score = 1 / (1 + total_dev)
efficiency = advance_speed / revolution_rpm

# Display with color coding
if quality_score > 0.8: status = "ðŸŸ¢ Excellent"
elif quality_score > 0.5: status = "ðŸŸ¡ Good"  
elif quality_score > 0.3: status = "ðŸŸ  Acceptable"
else: status = "ðŸ”´ Poor"
```

### 2. Automated Alerts
```python
# Set up automated alerts based on engineered features
if alignment_quality < 0.3:
    alert("Poor alignment detected - manual intervention required")
    
if ground_resistance > threshold:
    alert("Hard ground conditions - reduce advance speed")
    
if deviation_trend > 0.5:  # Getting worse
    alert("Deviation trend deteriorating - check steering system")
```

### 3. ML Model Training
```python
# Use engineered features for ML model training
feature_columns = [
    'total_deviation_machine', 'alignment_quality', 'deviation_difference',
    'steering_cylinder_range', 'specific_energy', 'cutting_efficiency', 
    'ground_resistance', 'pressure_ratio', 'operational_efficiency'
]

X = df[feature_columns]
y = df['target_variable']
model.fit(X, y)
```
