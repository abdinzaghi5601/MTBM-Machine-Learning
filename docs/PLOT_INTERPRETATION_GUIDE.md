**File**: `outputs/plots/mtbm_time_series_overview.png`

### What It Shows
A 6x4 grid showing 23+ parameters over time, grouped by function:
- Row 1: Survey Position (tunnel length, deviations)
- Row 2: Survey Orientation (yaw, pitch, reel, temperature)
- Row 3: Steering Control (4 cylinder strokes)
- Row 4: Operational (advance speed, forces)
- Row 5: Cutter Wheel (pressure, RPM, earth pressure)
- Row 6: Efficiency Metrics

### How to Read It

#### Color Coding by Group
- **Orange** = Survey Position parameters
- **Green** = Survey Orientation parameters
- **Red** = Steering Control parameters

- **Purple** = Efficiency metrics

### Good Indicators ✅

1. **Smooth Trends**
   - Parameters should change gradually
   - No sudden spikes or drops
   - Example: Tunnel length should increase steadily

2. **Stable Deviations**
   - Horizontal and vertical deviations oscillate around zero
   - Total deviation stays low (<50mm)
   - Corrections are smooth, not abrupt

3. **Coordinated Cylinder Movement**
   - All 4 cylinders show related patterns
   - Move together to correct deviations
   - Stay within 20-80mm stroke range

4. **Consistent Operational Parameters**
   - Advance speed maintains steady pace
   - Working pressure stays in 140-180 bar range
   - RPM relatively constant (7-11)

### Warning Signs ⚠️

   - Indicates possible sensor malfunction or ground condition change
   - **Action**: Investigate cause, check sensors

2. **Trending Away from Normal**
   - Continuous increase/decrease beyond normal range
   - Example: Temperature steadily rising above 30°C

3. **Cylinder Saturation**
   - One or more cylinders stuck at extreme positions (0mm or 100mm)
   - Cannot provide further correction
   - **Action**: Adjust tunnel alignment strategy

4. **Declining Efficiency**
   - Drilling efficiency trending downward
   - More pressure needed for same advance speed
   - **Action**: Check cutter wear, inspect chamber

## 4. Correlation Matrix

**File**: `outputs/plots/mtbm_correlation_matrix.png`

### What It Shows
Heat map showing how every parameter relates to every other parameter.

### How to Read

**Correlation Values**:
- **+1.0** (Dark red): Perfect positive correlation (both increase together)
- **0.0** (White): No correlation (independent)
- **-1.0** (Dark blue): Perfect negative correlation (one increases, other decreases)

**Colors**:
- **Red shades**: Positive correlation
- **Blue shades**: Negative correlation
- **White**: No relationship

### Expected Strong Correlations ✅

These are normal and indicate system working correctly:

1. **Tunnel Length ↔ Timestamp** (+0.9 to +1.0)
   - Should be strongly positive (more time = more tunnel)

2. **Horizontal Deviation ↔ Horizontal Drill Head Deviation** (+0.7 to +0.9)
   - Machine and drill head move together

3. **Working Pressure ↔ Earth Pressure** (+0.5 to +0.7)
   - Should maintain balance

4. **Advance Speed ↔ Revolution RPM** (+0.3 to +0.5)
   - Higher RPM generally allows higher speed

5. **Cylinder 01 ↔ Cylinder 03** (-0.5 to -0.7)
   - Opposite cylinders work against each other (negative correlation normal)

6. **Total Force ↔ Cylinder Strokes** (+0.4 to +0.6)
   - Cylinder extension creates force

### Concerning Correlations ⚠️

These indicate problems:

1. **Any Parameter ↔ Itself ≠ 1.0**
   - **Meaning**: Data error or sensor failure
   - **Action**: Check data quality

2. **Advance Speed ↔ Working Pressure** (<0.2)
   - **Meaning**: Pressure not translating to progress
   - **Problem**: Equipment inefficiency or difficult ground
   - **Action**: Investigate cause

3. **Earth Pressure ↔ Working Pressure** (<0.3 or >0.9)
   - **Too low**: Unstable chamber conditions
   - **Too high**: Sensors measuring same thing (sensor problem)
   - **Action**: Verify chamber operations, check sensors

4. **Unexpected Strong Correlations** (|r| > 0.8 between unrelated parameters)
   - Example: Temperature ↔ Horizontal Deviation
   - **Meaning**: Likely spurious correlation or sensor cross-talk
   - **Action**: Investigate measurement systems

5. **Deviation Parameters ↔ Steering Cylinders** (<0.1)
   - **Meaning**: Steering not responding to deviations
   - **Problem**: Control system failure
   - **Action**: Check steering control system immediately

### Using Correlation Matrix for Troubleshooting

**Scenario 1**: Advance speed decreasing but no change in pressure
- **Check**: Correlation between speed ↔ pressure
- **If low**: Pressure not being effective (worn cutters likely)
- **Action**: Schedule cutter inspection

**Scenario 2**: High deviations despite active steering
- **Check**: Correlation between deviation ↔ cylinder strokes
- **If low**: Steering not responding properly
- **Action**: Check hydraulic system and control logic

**Scenario 3**: Erratic readings on multiple parameters
- **Check**: Multiple unexpected strong correlations
- **If present**: Likely sensor/data logging issue
- **Action**: Verify data acquisition system
